# Chips Parlour
Phillip Healy's Milestone Project 2: Interactive Front End Development. A place to play parlour games online. 
Minimum Viable Project scope is 1 game (Code Breaker) with 3 difficulties.

2 scores will be recorded; fastest code break, and longest streak.

## UX

As a game creator I want a site to put all my parlour type games on.
As a player I want to be able to play fun games.
As a pro gamer I want to be able to challenge myself with higher difficulties.
As a competitive player I want to see my high scores.
As a novice player I want to be able to see how to play.
As a fellow developer I want to be able to contact the dev for collaboration.
As an enthusiast I want to be able to contact the dev to leave a review.

## Features

### Existing Features

This is a site on which to play a collection of games. Initially there is a single game with 3 difficulties: Code Breaker.

Code Breaker is a puzzle game where 4 coloured nodes can be selected via clicks or taps and tested against a secret (randomly generated) code. If you get a colour placed correctly 
it will be highlighted in green and you can try again up to 8 times, after which you fail and the code is revealed. Get them all correct to win!

Easy difficulty is 5 colours, medium is 6, hard is 7.

### Future Features
I will be adding games to this page periodically. I've ideas for dozens of games, from card games, 
board games, puzzles, role play sims, choose your own adventures, and more!
I will also be updating the site to be as user friendly to anyone with accessibility issues, including Dark Mode, 
Colourblind mode, screen reader friendly, keyboard only controls, etc.

## Technologies Used

### JQuery
- The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation, and is the primary interactivity of the site

### Bootstrap
- HTML/CSS framework for developing mobile-first front end.

### Balsamiq
- Wireframing tool used to create mock ups of each page for each media size.


## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

### Contact form:
- Go to the "Contact Us" page
- Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
- Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
- Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
- In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

### Bugs Encountered
Friday 30/4 - had a power outage that wiped a couple of hours of work.


## Deployment


## Credits
### Content
Code Breaker is a generic game modelled after Mastermind; a wooden peg boardgame released by Mordekai Meirowitz in the 1970s. 
Though the origin of the game comes from at least the 1800s on pen and  paper under the name "Bulls and Cows".

Originally I was going to do a choose your own adventure, but my wife talked me down from creating 800+ branches of story.
She is my greatest inspiration and helps to anchor me to the earth when my head is in the clouds.
