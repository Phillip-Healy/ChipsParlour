# Chips Parlour
Phillip Healy's Milestone Project 2: Interactive Front End Development. A place to play parlour games online. 
Minimum Viable Project scope is 1 game (Code Breaker) with 3 difficulties.

2 scores will be recorded; fastest code break, and longest streak.

## UX

As a game creator I want a site to put all my parlour type games on.
As a player I want to be able to play fun games.
As a pro gamer I want to be able to challenge myself with higher difficulties.
As a competitive player I want to see my high scores.
As a novice player I want to be able to see how to play.
As a fellow developer I want to be able to contact the dev for collaboration.
As an enthusiast I want to be able to contact the dev to leave a review.

## Features

### Existing Features

This is a site on which to play a collection of games. Initially there is a single game with 3 difficulties: Code Breaker.

Code Breaker is a puzzle game where 4 coloured nodes can be selected via clicks or taps and tested against a secret (randomly generated) code. If you get a colour placed correctly 
it will be highlighted in green and you can try again up to 8 times, after which you fail and the code is revealed. Get them all correct to win!

Easy difficulty is 5 colours, medium is 6, hard is 7.

### Future Features

## Technologies Used

### JQuery
- The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

### Contact form:
- Go to the "Contact Us" page
- Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
- Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
- Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
- In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

### Bugs Encountered
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
